RESTful API: 6 architectural constraints

1. uniform interface (统一的接口)

2. client-server
    - client and server application must be separate without any dependency
    - client should only know resource URIs

3. stateless
    - the server will not store anything from client side
    - it imporves performance between client and server
    
4. cacheable
    - caching of data and responses is important and should be used

5. layered system
    - where you deploy the APIs on server A
    - where you store data on server B
    - where you authenticate requests in Server C

6. conde on demand (optional)
